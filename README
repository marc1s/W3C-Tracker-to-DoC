This tool helps W3C spec writers produce a Disposition of Comments from a W3C Tracker.

Partial summary of steps:

1. Export the tracker data in XML format: If the tracker is at https://example.com/track/, export it as https://example.com/track/api/dump

2. Place the entire xml dump into file "ir.xml" in the current directory.

3. Adapt the settings in run.sh and W3C_Tracker_XML_DoC.groovy to match your spec.

4. Run run.sh. Upon success, you will see (on a mac, at least) the generated html file in your browser.

5. Iterate until satisfied.

6. Do the rest by hand.
